### Project Description
Our project is a web based application. GeoAttendance leverages geofencing technology to enhance the accuracy and convenience of attendance tracking. Geofencing involves creating virtual boundaries in real-world geographic areas, only the users within thhe boundaries will be able to check-in. Upon checking-in, the users will receive an email which confirms their attendance status. Our website also provides real-time updates on attendance and historical attendance data as well.

### Market Space and Selling Point 
* The application streamlines attendance tracking for professors and other hosts.
* Geomarking and online maps allows attendees to easily find meeting spots through their phone, without the hassle of going through manual instructions.
* An online application would easily allow the host to update events, or modify sign-ups. All attendees would simultaneously be able to track any changes or updates immediately, such as if a location were changed.
