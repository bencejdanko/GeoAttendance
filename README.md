### Project Description

Our project is a web based application. GeoAttendance leverages geofencing technology to enhance the accuracy and convenience of attendance tracking. Geofencing involves creating virtual boundaries in real-world geographic areas, only the users within thhe boundaries will be able to check-in. Upon checking-in, the users will receive an email which confirms their attendance status. Our website also provides real-time updates on attendance and historical attendance data as well.
